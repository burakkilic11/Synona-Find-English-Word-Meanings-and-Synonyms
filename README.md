When you're trying to learn English, you often try to watch videos without translating them into your native language, aiming to understand directly in English. Most of the time, you can grasp the general context, but sometimes you just need to check the meaning of a single word.

However, this usually means opening a new tab, going to a translation site, typing the word — a process that interrupts your flow and breaks the enjoyment of watching the video. That’s exactly why I decided to develop Synona, a Chrome extension designed to solve this problem.

All you need to do is click on the extension while watching the video and say the word you want to learn. Instantly, you'll see the meaning, synonyms, and antonyms of the word, and you can continue watching your video without losing your focus or momentum.

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
